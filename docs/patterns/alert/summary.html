<p>
    Alerts should be used to provide feedback to the user. They are intended to serve informational message, errors and
    warnings.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to set a title for an alert. Simply add an element that has the class <code>zui-alert-title</code> 
    on it and it will act as the title.
</p>

<p>
    In order to make alerts closable, simply add the close icon. JavaScript will automatically recognize it and close 
    the alert when you click on it.
