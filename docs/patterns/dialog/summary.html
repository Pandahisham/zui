<p>
    Dialogs should be used when the user is asked a user for information that cannot be ignored. A great example would 
    be to ask a user if he or she is sure to delete an entity. Another good example is to provide a quick way to create
    an entity without redirecting the user to a separate page.

<h3>AJAX Dialogs</h3>

<p>
    It is possible to load dialogs via AJAX. The AJAX request should return the entire HTML code of the dialog. This
    means that the the entire HTML between (and including) the <code>&lt;div class="zui-dialog"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
    elements.
