<p>
    The layout pattern defines how a page looks like. There are three layout types. The first layout is a fluid
    layout. The fluid layout is set by default. The second layout is a fixed layout. The fixed layout sets the width
    of the content to a fixed width. Third there is a hybrid layout, it's a layout where the top bar acts as a fluid 
    layout but the content has a fixed width.
