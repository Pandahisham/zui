<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    ZUI is a pattern library developed for <a href="https://github.com/zource">Zource</a>. This library is a collection
    of commont user interface elements that are used in advanced web applications. Zource makes use of these elements.
    It is important to realize that ZUI is not designed for your average daily website. It's meant to be used in 
    web-applications.
</p>

<h2>Why this library</h2>

<p>
    This library has been developed to make sure that the visual appearance and the functionality of the user interface
    works the same throughout applications made by Zource. A smooth user experience for Zource applications is important
    and ZUI plays a big part to accomplish this.

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>
    This library is developed from the ground up. Yet we did use existing libraries as reference material. We 
    especially love <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/">Atlassian's AUI</a> and 
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb's Foundation</a>. This library also makes extensive use of 
    <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
